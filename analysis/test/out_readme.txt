We do not have good FuuL expression for now. So the results are without FuuL terms

born is for born cross section, rad is for cross section with radiative effects

The cross section has dphis, should be multiplied by 2pi

*all_out_short.txt is for FuuT+Fuucosphi+Fuucos2phi
*FuuT_out_short.txt is for FuuT only
*FuuT_cos_out_short.txt is for FuuT+Fuucosphi
